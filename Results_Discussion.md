# Results and Discussion

The D-flip flop module generated was converted into partially adiabatic circuits by simply
converting the fundamental block i.e the ‘nand2’ into an adiabatic logic design.

In the analysis and simulation of partially adiabatic D-flip flop circuit using HSPICE simulations,
it is observed several key findings that shed light on its performance and energy efficiency. SPICE
library used in this study : TSMC 180um (tsmc018.lib)

The waveform of the d-flip flop created is given as under. This signal is observed and analysed in
the simulation tool named as `Avan-waves` :
