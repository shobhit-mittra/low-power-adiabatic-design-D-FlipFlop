# Adiabatic Circuits :

The term ‘Adiabatic’ originates from the domain of Thermodynamics which means a system that does not lose its internal energy to the surroundings. This concept can be extended to electronics circuit design especially for low-power applications. Adiabatic circuit methodology revolves around the idea that the power-dissipation can be greatly reduced if a portion of the power present in the circuit can be reused for the next cycle of operation.

The adiabatic circuit methodology is a novel way to solve the urgent problem of power dissipation in digital circuits in the field of electronics. It is based on the intriguing idea that a large amount of the electrical power that is naturally present in the circuit can be effectively captured and used again in later operating cycles. Put another way, adiabatic circuits try to capture, store, and then use this energy to complete future computing tasks rather than letting it go to waste in the form of heat or other types of loss.

This brilliant idea, which is related to the thermodynamic principle of preserving heat and energy in a closed system, is what motivates the creation of circuit designs that are energy efficient. Adiabatic circuits help cut power consumption, extend battery life, and create more sustainable electronic gadgets by carefully controlling the flow of energy and designing systems that minimise waste. The requirement for energy-efficient and environmentally responsible designs is one of the major difficulties facing modern electronics, and this approach has therefore attracted a lot of attention and academic interest.

The report focuses on the partially adiabatic circuits. Unlike, fully adiabatic circuit methodology that revolves around replacing the pull-up and pull-down network by transmission gates, partially adiabatic circuits incorporate a more robust and intuitive way to address the concern for low-power applications while taking into account the upsurge in transistor count. The focus resides on the partially adiabatic types as under :

## ENERGY CHARGE RECOVERY LOGIC (ECRL):
ECRL circuits, as previously discussed, focus on energy recovery and recycling. They capture energy during logic transitions and aim to minimize power consumption by reusing the captured energy in subsequent operations. ECRL is a well-established partially adiabatic circuit design with a primary emphasis on energy efficiency.

## 2N-2N2P LOGIC:
The 2N-2N2P logic is a type of partially adiabatic circuit that combines both N-type and P-type transistors in its design. It leverages the complementary nature of these transistors to achieve power-efficient operation. By using both N-type and P-type devices, it can reduce energy consumption during switching transitions.

## POSITIVE FEEDBACK ADIABATIC LOGIC (PFAL):
PFAL circuits are designed to minimize energy dissipation by employing positive feedback loops. These loops enhance the energy recovery process, making PFAL a notable choice for low-power applications. The use of positive feedback helps reduce power consumption during logic transitions.
These types of partially adiabatic circuits share the common goal of improving energy efficiency and reducing power consumption in digital systems. They achieve this goal through various design principles, energy recovery mechanisms, and circuit architectures. The choice between these circuit types should be based on the specific requirements of your application and the trade-offs between power efficiency and other performance metrics, such as speed and area.
