# Design Methodology :

In HSPICE, designing a D flip-flop (D-FF) entails several stages, such as building and connecting necessary sub-circuits. Sequential logic relies heavily on the D-FF, a key building element in digital circuit architecture. This is a summary of the design process you have explained:

## BUILDING THE "NAND2" SUB-CIRCUIT, A 2-INPUT NAND GATE:
To design a D-FF, you start by building a sub-circuit for a 'nand2', or two-input NAND gate. The NAND gate's attributes, including its input pins, output, and logical behaviour, are described in this sub-circuit definition. The 'nand2' sub-circuit functions as the fundamental building block for the other parts.

## ESTABLISHING SLAVE AND MASTER SUB-CIRCUITS:
The master latch and the slave latch are the two main parts of the D-FF design. The 'nand2' sub-circuit that was previously established is used to build both parts.
- Master Latch: The required logic is implemented by using instances of the 'nand2' sub-circuit to form the master latch. When the clock signal is not active, the master latch retains the incoming data input (D) and features a feedback path to hold the data.
- Slave Latch: Using instances of the 'nand2' sub-circuit once more, the slave latch is created in a similar manner. When the clock signal is active, it oversees storing the data from the master latch and moving it to the output.

## MASTER AND SLAVE MODULES CASCADING TO CREATE THE D-FLIP FLOP:
Connecting the master and slave latch modules to create the entire flip-flop is the last stage in the D-FF design process. The master latch is connected to the data input (D), while the slave latch is connected to the master latch's output. The D-FF uses the clock signal as a control signal to decide when to move data from the master latch to the slave latch.
Digital circuit design relies heavily on the D-FF, which makes sequential logic and binary data storage possible. Depending on the implementation, its cascaded architecture of master and slave latches guarantees that data is stored on the rising or falling edge of the clock signal.
Overall, by utilising the fundamental 2-input NAND gate building block and correctly linking master and slave latches to accomplish the required functionality for your digital circuits, you may make a bespoke D flip-flop utilising this HSPICE design process.
